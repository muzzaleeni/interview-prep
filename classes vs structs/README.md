Structs in C++ originate from C, where they were used to group variables into a user-defined type, but they couldn't contain functions since C lacked object-oriented features like methods. 

In C++, structs are often used for "classes with no methods," reflecting their traditional use in C. However, aside from defaulting to public access, structs and classes are essentially the same in C++.
